I expressed interest in Consenz's Social Media Management / Content Creation role. However, the Snapbrilla did not allow me to upload my resume and cover letter. I tried two different file types, neither work. It would be ideal if the Snapbrilla website showed which types of files it accepts for uploads. Please let me know how I can submit my cover letter and resume for the Consenz role.
